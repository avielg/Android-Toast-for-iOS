Android-Toast-for-iOS
=====================

This is a simple Class that adds an easy option to create android-like toasts for iOS.
All the normal settings (size, color. margin etc...) can be changed via the h file in one of the #define lines.

This is my first rep on git, feel free to comment, fork, and crit (:

Aviel.
